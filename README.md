## blackjack project description
A reinvention of the classical blackjack game to practice basic OOP principles

## Reflection
It was my first project focusing on object-oriented programming, but I enjoyed making it nonetheless. Additionally, I reinforced my understanding of while loops and error handling. I made the game ideally for one person, but potential areas where I could expand could have been:
  * Additional levels
  * Making it a multiplayer game
